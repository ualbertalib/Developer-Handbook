[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/)] is used for continuous integration. It is used to test builds, run tests, and check style. It is configured using [.travis.yml](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) in the project directory and is run on changes to PR and master branches via hooks in Github.
