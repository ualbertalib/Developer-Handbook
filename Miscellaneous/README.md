If you're used to using ```grep``` to search for a term in a subset of your file system consider using ```ack``` or ```ag``` instead.  ```ag``` is 'The Silver Searcher' and can be invoked like this:
```
ag -i term /path/to/search
```
and it will provide coloured results with the path, filename, line number and context
